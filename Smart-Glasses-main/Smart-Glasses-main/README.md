# Smart-Blind-Glasses

# INTRODUCTION
Smart-Blind-Glasses ðŸ‘“  are a specific type of eyewear that enables blind persons to see print rather than Braille.In these glasses, we take input from the camera at a rate of roughly 5 frames per second, convert the text that is written in those frames, and then further turn the text into speech in the user's local tongue.

This project calls for a Raspberry Pi, a camera, earbuds, and some simple eyewear. All of the data is kept on a raspberry pi CPU, which can also communicate information over earbuds and capture live video frames using a camera.
